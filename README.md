<h1>Hi, I'm Jan Swierblewski</h1>

I am a recent graduate of the 3rd Secondary School in Kalisz (mathematics and physics profile). I'm currently focused on developing my skills in Python, especially in the context of AI and machine learning. I'm also expanding my frontend knowledge, working with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. I'm passionate about building useful tools and exploring how artificial intelligence can be applied in real-world projects.
